Distribution: Koderma, Giridih, and Hazaribagh are the primary districts in Jharkhand where mica mines are found. Jharkhand is one of the leading states in India for mica production.
Environmental Concerns: Mica mining in Jharkhand is often associated with child labor, as children are often involved in hazardous mining activities. Besides the social issues, mica mining poses environmental risks like soil degradation and water pollution. Unregulated mining can result in the loss of fertile soil and disrupt the local ecology, affecting both flora and fauna.
