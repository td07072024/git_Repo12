Distribution: The Singhbhum district of Jharkhand is known for its rich iron ore deposits. The Noamundi Iron Ore Mine is one of the major sources of iron ore in the state, contributing significantly to India's iron ore production.
Environmental Impact: Iron ore mining, like any mining activity, poses challenges to the environment. The extraction process involves extensive land clearance, leading to habitat destruction and soil erosion. Additionally, mining activities may lead to water pollution due to the release of sediments and chemical pollutants. Adequate measures are required to mitigate these impacts and ensure sustainable mining practices.
