Distribution: Jharkhand is renowned for its abundant coal reserves, making it a significant contributor to India's coal production. The Jharia Coalfield, situated in the Dhanbad district, stands as one of the largest and most productive coal mines in the country.
Effects of Coal Mining: Coal mining in Jharkhand has both positive and negative impacts. While it fuels economic growth and provides employment opportunities, it also raises serious environmental concerns. The extensive mining activities lead to land degradation, disrupt natural ecosystems, and contribute to air and water pollution. Moreover, the burning of coal releases greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming and climate change.
